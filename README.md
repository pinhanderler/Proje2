Async WorldEdit - Edit millions of blocks without lag!

This plugin has only one function: eliminate the lag caused by WorldEdit! 
This is done by replacing the WorldEdit's session with a special asynchronous 
one. All the block drawing is done in packages. The package size and how often
the blocks are drawn are configurable in the config. AsyncWorldEdit is not a
reimplementation of WorldEdit! It attaches the original WorldEdit API and 
WorldEdit classes and tries to fix the lag. Therefore you have access to all
the WorldEdit operations, and all those operations work exactly like in the 
original WorldEdit. So basically you get the same commands, same permissions 
and the same experience. In addition to that if the WorldEdit team releases a new 
feature or fixes a bug all you need to do is update WorldEdit and AWE will do its
job as usual.
